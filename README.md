# Isomap Visualization of Digits

This project demonstrates the use of Isomap for dimensionality reduction and visualization of digit images.


## Introduction

This project loads a subset of the digits dataset, applies Isomap for dimensionality reduction to 2D, and visualizes the results with a scatter plot. The code is implemented in Python using scikit-learn and matplotlib.

## Features

- Dimensionality reduction with Isomap
- Visualization of digit images in 2D space

## Getting Started
